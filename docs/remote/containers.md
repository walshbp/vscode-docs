# Developing inside a Container

The **Visual Studio Code Remote - Containers** extension lets you use a [Docker container](https://docker.com) as a full-featured development environment. It allows you to open any folder inside (or mounted into) a container and take advantage of Visual Studio Code's full feature set. A [devcontainer.json file](#creating-a-devcontainerjson-file) in your project tells VS Code how to access (or create) a **development container** with a well-defined tool and runtime stack. This container can be used to run an application or to sandbox tools, libraries, or runtimes needed for working with a codebase.

Workspace files are mounted from the local file system or copied or cloned into the container. Extensions are installed and run inside the container, where they have full access to the tools, platform, and file system. This means that you can seamlessly switch your entire development environment just by connecting to a different container.

![Container Architecture](images/containers/architecture-containers.png)

This lets VS Code provide a **local-quality development experience** — including full IntelliSense (completions), code navigation, and debugging — **regardless of where your tools (or code) are located**.

## Getting started

### System requirements

**Local:**

* **Windows:** [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) 2.0+ on Windows 10 Pro/Enterprise. (Docker Toolbox is not supported. Windows container images are not supported.)
* **macOS**:  [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) 2.0+.
* **Linux**: [Docker CE/EE](https://docs.docker.com/install/#supported-platforms) 18.06+ and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install) 1.21+. (The Ubuntu snap package is not supported.)

**Containers**:

* x86_64 / ARMv7l (AArch32) / ARMv8l (AArch64) Debian 9+, Ubuntu 16.04+, CentOS / RHEL 7+
* x86_64 Alpine Linux 3.7+

Other `glibc` based Linux containers may work if they have [needed prerequisites](/docs/remote/linux.md).

While ARMv7l (AArch32), ARMv8l (AArch64), and `musl` based Alpine Linux support is available, some extensions installed on these devices may not work due to the use of `glibc` or `x86` compiled native code in the extension. See the [Remote Development with Linux](/docs/remote/linux.md) article for details.

While the Docker CLI is required, the Docker daemon/service does not need to be running locally if you are [using a remote Docker host](/docs/remote/containers-advanced.md#developing-inside-a-container-on-a-remote-docker-host).

### Installation

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Install and configure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) for your operating system.

    **Windows / macOS**:

    1. Install [Docker Desktop for Windows/Mac](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

    2. Right-click on the Docker taskbar item and select the **Settings** menu item (**Preferences** on macOS) and update **Resources > File Sharing** with any source code locations you want to open in a container. If you run into trouble, see [Docker Desktop for Windows tips](/docs/remote/troubleshooting.md#docker-desktop-for-windows-tips) on avoiding common problems with sharing.

    **Linux**:

    1. Follow the [official install instructions for Docker CE/EE for your distribution](https://docs.docker.com/install/#supported-platforms). If you are using Docker Compose, follow the [Docker Compose directions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) as well.

    2. Add your user to the `docker` group by using a terminal to run: `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`

    3. Sign out and back in again so your changes take effect.

2. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Visual Studio Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/).

3. Install the [Remote Development extension pack](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/download/extension).

**Working with Git?** Here are two tips to consider:

* If you are working with the same repository both locally in Windows and inside a container, be sure to set up consistent line endings. See [tips and tricks](/docs/remote/troubleshooting.md#resolving-git-line-ending-issues-in-containers-resulting-in-many-modified-files) for details.
* If you clone using a Git credential manager, your container should already have access to your credentials! If you use SSH keys, you can also opt in to sharing them. See [Sharing Git credentials with your container](#sharing-git-credentials-with-your-container) for details.

**Next Steps:** The Remote - Containers extension supports two primary operating models:

* You can use a container as your [full-time development environment](#creating-a-devcontainerjson-file).
* You can [attach to a running container](#attaching-to-running-containers) to inspect it.

We will cover using a container as your full-time development environment first.

## Quick start: Try a dev container

Let's start by using a sample project to try things out.

1. Start VS Code, and in a new window, click on the quick actions Status Bar item in the lower left corner.

    ![Quick actions Status bar item](images/common/remote-dev-status-bar.png)

2. Select **Remote-Containers: Try a Sample...** from the command list that appears and select sample from the list.

    ![Select a sample from the list](images/containers/select-a-sample.png)

3. The window will then reload, but since the container does not exist yet, VS Code will create one and clone the sample repository into an isolated [container volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/). This may take some time, and a progress notification will provide status updates. Fortunately, this step isn't necessary the next time you open the folder since the container will already exist.

    ![Dev Container Progress Notification](images/containers/dev-container-progress.png)

4. After the container is built, VS Code automatically connects to it and maps the project folder from your local file system into the container. Check out the **Things to try** section of `README.md` in the repository you cloned to see what to do next.

You may be wondering where the repository source code is located. In this case, the source code is stored in a [container volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) which is not directly accessible from your local operating system. However, you can work with content in your local filesystem from a container as well! We'll cover that next.

## Quick start: Open an existing folder in a container

Next we will cover how to set up a dev container for an existing project to use as your full-time development environment using existing source code on your filesystem. Follow these steps:

1. Start VS Code, run the **Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...** command from the Command Palette (`kbstyle(F1)`) or quick actions Status bar item, and select the project folder you would like to set up the container for.

    > **Tip:** If you want to edit the container's contents or settings before opening the folder, you can run **Remote-Containers: Add Development Container Configuration Files...** instead.

    ![Quick actions Status bar item](images/common/remote-dev-status-bar.png)

2. Now pick a starting point for your dev container. You can either select a base **dev container definition** from a filterable list, or use an existing [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) or [Docker Compose file](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#compose-file-structure-and-examples) if one exists in the folder you selected.

    > **Note:** When using Alpine Linux containers, some extensions may not work due to `glibc` dependencies in native code inside the extension.

    ![Select a node dev container definition](images/containers/select-dev-container-def.png)

    Note the dev container definitions displayed come from the [vscode-dev-containers repository](https://aka.ms/vscode-dev-containers). You can browse the `containers` folder of that repository to see the contents of each definition.

3. After picking the starting point for your container, VS Code will add the dev container configuration files to your project (`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`).

4. The VS Code window will reload and start building the dev container. A progress notification provides status updates. You only have to build a dev container the first time you open it; opening the folder after the first successful build will be much quicker.

    ![Dev Container Progress Notification](images/containers/dev-container-progress.png)

5. After the build completes, VS Code will automatically connect to the container.

You can now interact with your project in VS Code just as you could when opening the project locally. From now on, when you open the project folder, VS Code will automatically pick up and reuse your dev container configuration.

> **Tip:** Want to use a remote Docker host? See the [Advanced Containers article](/docs/remote/containers-advanced.md#developing-inside-a-container-on-a-remote-docker-host) for details on setup.

While using this approach to [bind mount](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/) the local filesystem into a container is convenient, it does have some performance overhead on Windows and macOS. There are [some techniques](/docs/remote/containers-advanced.md#improving-container-disk-performance) that you can apply to improve disk performance, or you can [open a repository in a container using a isolated container volume](#quick-start-open-a-git-repository-or-github-pr-in-an-isolated-container-volume) instead.

### Open an existing workspace in a container

You can also follow a similar process to open a [VS Code multi-root workspace](/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces) in a **single container** if the workspace only **references relative paths to sub-folders of the folder the `.code-workspace` file is in (or the folder itself).**

You can either:

* Use the **Remote-Containers: Open Workspace in Container...** command.
* Use **File > Open Workspace...** once you have opened a folder that contains a `.code-workspace` file in a container.

Once connected, you may want to **add the `.devcontainer` folder** to the workspace so you can easily edit its contents if it is not already visible.

Also note that, while you cannot use multiple containers for the same workspace in the same VS Code window, you can use [multiple Docker Compose managed containers at once](/docs/remote/containers-advanced.md#connecting-to-multiple-containers-at-once) from separate windows.

## Quick start: Open a Git repository or GitHub PR in an isolated container volume

While you can [open a locally cloned repository in a container](#quick-start-open-an-existing-folder-in-a-container), you may want to work with an isolated copy of a repository for a PR review or to investigate another branch without impacting your work.

Repository Containers use isolated, local Docker volumes instead binding to the local filesystem. In addition to not polluting your file tree, local volumes have the added benefit of improved performance on Windows and macOS. (See [Advanced Configuration](/docs/remote/containers-advanced.md#improving-container-disk-performance) for information on how to use these types of volumes in other scenarios.)

For example, follow these steps to open one of the "try" repositories in a Repository Container:

1. Start VS Code and run **Remote-Containers: Open Repository in Container...** from the Command Palette (`kbstyle(F1)`).

2. Enter `microsoft/vscode-remote-try-node` (or one of the other "try" repositories), a Git URI, a GitHub branch URL, or a GitHub PR URL in the input box that appears and press `kbstyle(Enter)`.

    ![Input box with a repository name in it](images/containers/vscode-remote-try-node.png)

    > **Tip:** If you choose a private repository, you may want to setup a credential manager or add your SSH keys to your SSH agent. See [Sharing Git credentials with your container](#sharing-git-credentials-with-your-container).

3. If your repository does not have a `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file in it, you'll be asked to pick a starting point from a filterable list or an existing [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) or [Docker Compose file](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#compose-file-structure-and-examples) (if one exists).

    > **Note:** When using Alpine Linux containers, some extensions may not work due to `glibc` dependencies in native code inside the extension.

    ![Select a node dev container definition](images/containers/select-dev-container-def.png)

    Note the dev container definitions displayed come from the [vscode-dev-containers repository](https://aka.ms/vscode-dev-containers). You can browse the `containers` folder of that repository to see the contents of each definition.

4. The VS Code window (instance) will reload, clone the source code, and start building the dev container. A progress notification provides status updates.

    ![Dev Container Progress Notification](images/containers/dev-container-progress.png)

    If you pasted in a Github pull request URL in step 2, the PR will be automatically checked out and the [GitHub Pull Requests](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) extension will be installed in the container. The extension provides additional PR related features like a PR explorer, interacting with PR comments inline, and status bar visibility.

    ![PR status in status bar](images/containers/checkout-pr-status.png)

5. After the build completes, VS Code will automatically connect to the container.You can now work with the repository source code in this isolated environment as you would if you had cloned the code locally.

> **Tip:** Want to use a remote Docker host? See the [Advanced Containers article](/docs/remote/containers-advanced.md#developing-inside-a-container-on-a-remote-docker-host) for details on setup.

## Quick start: Configure a sandbox for multiple projects or folders

While development containers often are tied to a single folder, repository, or project, they can also be used with multiple folders as a way to simplify setup or sandbox your tools. Imagine you had your source code across multiple repositories in a single folder for a given toolset.

For example:

```text
📁 Repos
   📁 node
   📁 python
      📁 starter-snake-python
      📁 vscode-remote-try-python
      📁 your-python-project-here
   📁 go
   📁 dotnet
```

Let's set up a container for use with all of the Python projects in the `./Repos/python` folder.

1. Start VS Code, select **Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...** from the Command Palette (`kbstyle(F1)`) or quick actions Status bar item, and select the `./Repos/python` folder.

    > **Tip:** If you want to edit the container's contents or settings before opening the folder, you can run **Remote-Containers: Add Development Container Configuration Files...** instead.

    ![Quick actions Status bar item](images/common/remote-dev-status-bar.png)

2. Now pick a starting point for your dev container. You can either select a base **dev container definition** from a filterable list, or use an existing [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) or [Docker Compose file](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#compose-file-structure-and-examples) if one exists in the folder you selected.

    > **Note:** When using Alpine Linux containers, some extensions may not work due to `glibc` dependencies in native code inside the extension.

    ![Select a python dev container definition](images/containers/select-dev-container-def-python.png)

    Note the dev container definitions displayed come from the [vscode-dev-containers repository](https://aka.ms/vscode-dev-containers). You can browse the `containers` folder of that repository to see the contents of each definition.

3. After picking the starting point for your container, VS Code will add the dev container configuration files to the `./Repos/python/.devcontainer` folder.

4. The VS Code window will reload and start building the dev container. A progress notification provides status updates. You only have to build a dev container the first time you open it; opening the folder after the first successful build will be much quicker.

    ![Dev Container Progress Notification](images/containers/dev-container-progress.png)

5. After the build completes, VS Code will automatically connect to the container. Once connected use **File > Open... / Open Folder...** to select one of the folders under `./Repos/python`.

    ![Open python folder in the container](images/containers/open-folder-python.png)

6. In a moment, VS Code will open the folder inside the same container. In the future, you can use the **Remote Explorer** in the Activity Bar to open this sub-folder in the container directly.

    ![Container explorer with multiple folders under python container](images/containers/containers-explorer-python.png)

> **Tip:** Instead of mounting the local filesystem, you can use a similar flow to set up a container with an isolated, more performant volume that you clone your source code into. See the [Advanced Containers](/docs/remote/containers-advanced.md#use-a-named-volume-for-your-entire-source-tree) article for details.

## Creating a devcontainer.json file

VS Code's container configuration is stored in a [devcontainer.json](#devcontainerjson-reference) file. This file is similar to the `launch.json` file for debugging configurations, but is used for launching (or attaching to) your development container instead. You can also specify any extensions to install once the container is running or post-create commands to prepare the environment. The dev container configuration is either located under `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` or stored as a `.devcontainer.json` file (note the dot-prefix) in the root of your project.

You can use any image, Dockerfile, or set of Docker Compose files as a starting point. Here is a simple example that uses one of the pre-built [VS Code Development Container images](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-vscode-devcontainers):

```json
{
    "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/typescript-node:0-12",
    "forwardPorts": [ 3000 ],
    "extensions": [
        "dbaeumer.vscode-eslint"
    ]
}
```

Selecting the **Remote-Containers: Add Development Container Configuration Files...** command from the Command Palette (`kbstyle(F1)`) will add the needed files to your project as a starting point, which you can further customize for your needs.

The command lets you pick a pre-defined container configuration:

![Add a dev container definition](images/containers/select-dev-container-def-all.png)

Or reuse an existing Dockerfile:

![Add a dev container definition](images/containers/select-dockerfile.png)

Or reuse an existing Docker Compose file:

![Add a dev container definition](images/containers/select-docker-compose.png)

For example, through a `devcontainer.json` file, you can:

* Spin up a [stand-alone "sandbox" container](#indepth-setting-up-a-folder-to-run-in-a-container) to isolate your toolchain or speed up setup.
* Work with a container deployed application defined by an [image, Dockerfile](#using-an-image-or-dockerfile), or [Docker Compose](#using-docker-compose).
* [Use Docker or Kubernetes](/docs/remote/containers-advanced.md#using-docker-or-kubernetes-from-a-container) from inside a dev container to build and deploy your app.

All of the predefined container configurations you can pick from come from the [vscode-dev-containers repository](https://aka.ms/vscode-dev-containers), which has examples of `devcontainer.json` for different scenarios. You can [alter your configuration](#indepth-setting-up-a-folder-to-run-in-a-container) to:

* Install additional tools such as Git in the container.
* Automatically install extensions.
* Forward or publish additional ports.
* Set runtime arguments.
* Reuse or [extend your existing Docker Compose setup](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/docker-compose/extend).
* And more [advanced container configurations](/docs/remote/containers-advanced.md).

If `devcontainer.json`'s supported workflows do not meet your needs, you can also [attach to an already running container instead](#attaching-to-running-containers).

> **Tip:** Want to use a remote Docker host? See the [Advanced Containers article](/docs/remote/containers-advanced.md#developing-inside-a-container-on-a-remote-docker-host) for details on setup.

### Configuration edit loop

Editing your container configuration is easy. Since rebuilding a container will "reset" the container to its starting contents (with the exception of your local source code), VS Code does not automatically rebuild if you edit a container configuration file (`devcontainer.json`, `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`). Instead, there are several commands that can be used to make editing your configuration easier.

Here is the typical edit loop using these commands:

![Container edit loop illustration](images/containers/container-edit-loop.png)

1. Start with **Remote-Containers: Add Development Container Configuration Files...** in the Command Palette (`kbstyle(F1)`).
2. Edit the contents of the `.devcontainer` folder as required.
3. Try it with **Remote-Containers: Reopen Folder in Container**.
4. If you see an error, click on **Open Folder Locally** in the dialog that appears.
5. After the window reloads, a copy of the **build log will appear** in the so you can investigate the problem. Edit the contents of the `.devcontainer` folder as required. (You can also use the **Remote-Containers: Open Log File...** command to see the log again if you close it.)
1. Run **Remote-Containers: Rebuild and Reopen Folder in Container** and jump to step 4 if needed.

If you already have a successful build, you can still edit the contents of the `.devcontainer` folder as required when connected to the container and then select **Remote-Containers: Rebuild Container** in the Command Palette (`kbstyle(F1)`) so the changes take effect.

### Adding configuration files to public or private repositories

You can easily share a customized dev container definition for your project by adding `devcontainer.json` files to source control. By including these files in your repository, anyone that opens a local copy of your repo in VS Code will be automatically prompted to reopen the folder in a container, provided they have the Remote - Containers extension installed.

![Dev config file reopen notification](images/containers/dev-container-reopen-prompt.png)

Beyond the advantages of having your team use a consistent environment and tool-chain, this also makes it easier for new contributors or team members to be productive quickly. First-time contributors will require less guidance and hit fewer issues related to environment setup.

## Attaching to running containers

While using VS Code to spin up a new container can be useful in many situations, it may not match your workflow and you may prefer to "attach" VS Code to an already running Docker container - regardless of how it was started. Once attached, you can install extensions, edit, and debug like you can when you open a folder in a container using `devcontainer.json`.

> **Note:** When using Alpine Linux containers, some extensions may not work due to `glibc` dependencies in native code inside the extension.

### Attaching to a Docker container

To attach to a Docker container, either select the **Remote-Containers: Attach to Running Container...** command from the Command Palette (`kbstyle(F1)`) or use the **Remote Explorer** in the Activity Bar and select the **Connect to Container** inline action on the container you want to connect to.

![Containers Explorer screenshot](images/containers/containers-attach.png)

### Attached container configuration files

VS Code supports image-level configuration files to speed up setup when you repeatedly connect to a given Docker container. Once attached, anytime you open a folder, [install an extension](#managing-extensions), or [forward a port](#forwarding-or-publishing-a-port), a local image-specific configuration file will automatically be updated to remember your settings so that when you attach again, everything is back to the right place.

To see or edit the configuration, select **Remote-Containers: Open Attached Container Configuration File...** command from the Command Palette (`kbstyle(F1)`). The opened file supports a subset of `devcontainer.json` properties:

```json
{
    // Default path to open when attaching to a new container.
    "workspaceFolder": "/path/to/code/in/container/here",

    // An array of extension IDs that specify the extensions to
    // install inside the container when you first attach to it.
    "extensions": [
        "dbaeumer.vscode-eslint"
    ],

    // Any *default* container specific VS Code settings
    "settings": {
        "terminal.integrated.shell.linux": "/bin/bash"
    },

    // An array port numbers to forward
    "forwardPorts": [8000],

    // Container user VS Code should use when connecting
    "remoteUser": "vscode",

    // Set environment variables for VS Code and sub-processes
    "remoteEnv": { "MY_VARIABLE": "some-value" }
}
```

See the [attached container config reference](#attached-container-config-reference) for a complete list of properties and their uses.

Once saved, whenever you open a container for the first time with the same image name, these properties will be used to configure the environment.

Finally, if you have extensions you want installed regardless of the container you attach to, you can update `settings.json` to specify a list of [extensions that should always be installed](#always-installed-extensions). We will cover this option in the next section.

### Attaching to a container in a Kubernetes cluster

To attach to a container in a Kuberntes cluster, first install the [Kubernetes extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-kubernetes-tools.vscode-kubernetes-tools) and `kubectl` along with the Remote - Containers extension. Then select the Kubernetes explorer from the activity bar and expand the cluster and Pod where the container you want to attach to resides. Finally, right-click on the container and select **Attach Visual Studio Code** from context menu.

> **Note:** Attached container configuration files are not yet supported for containers in a Kubernetes cluster.

![Attach to Kubernetes Container](images/containers/k8s-attach.png)

## Managing extensions

VS Code runs extensions in one of two places: locally on the UI / client side, or in the container. While extensions that affect the VS Code UI, like themes and snippets, are installed locally, most extensions will reside inside a particular container. This allows you to install only the extensions you need for a given task in a container and seamlessly switch your entire tool-chain just by connecting to a new container.

If you install an extension from the Extensions view, it will automatically be installed in the correct location. You can tell where an extension is installed based on the category grouping. There will be a **Local - Installed** category and also one for your container.

![Workspace Extension Category](images/containers/containers-installed-remote-indicator.png)

![Local Extension Category](images/common/local-installed-extensions.png)

> **Note:** If you are an extension author and your extension is not working properly or installs in the wrong place, see [Supporting Remote Development](/api/advanced-topics/remote-extensions.md) for details.

Local extensions that actually need to run remotely will appear **Disabled** in the **Local - Installed** category. Select **Install** to install an extension on your remote host.

![Disabled Extensions w/Install Button](images/containers/containers-disabled-extensions.png)

You can also install all locally installed extensions inside the Dev Container by going to the Extensions view and selecting **Install Local Extensions in Dev Container: [Name]** from the **More Actions** menu (...).

![Install all extensions](images/containers/install-all-extn-containers.png)

However, some extensions may require you to [install additional software](#installing-additional-software) in the container. Consult extension documentation for details if you encounter issues.

### Adding an extension to devcontainer.json

While you can edit your [devcontainer.json](#creating-a-devcontainerjson-file) file by hand to add a list of extension IDs, you can also right-click on any extension in the Extensions view and select **Add to devcontainer.json**.

![Add to devcontainer.json menu](images/containers/containers-addto-devcontainer.png)

### "Always installed" extensions

If there are extensions that you would like always installed in any container, you can update the `remote.containers.defaultExtensions` User [setting](/docs/getstarted/settings.md). For example, if you wanted to install the [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) and [Resource Monitor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mutantdino.resourcemonitor) extensions, you would specify their extension IDs as follows:

```json
"remote.containers.defaultExtensions": [
    "eamodio.gitlens",
    "mutantdino.resourcemonitor"
]
```

### Advanced: Forcing an extension to run locally or remotely

Extensions are typically designed and tested to either run locally or remotely, not both. However, if an extension supports it, you can force it to run in a particular location in your `settings.json` file.

For example, the setting below will force the Docker extension to run locally and Debugger for Chrome extension to run remotely instead of their defaults:

```json
"remote.extensionKind": {
    "ms-azuretools.vscode-docker": [ "ui" ],
    "msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome": [ "workspace" ]
}
```

A value of `"ui"` instead of `"workspace"` will force the extension to run on the local UI/client side instead. Typically, this should only be used for testing unless otherwise noted in the extension's documentation since it **can break extensions**. See the article on [Supporting Remote Development](/api/advanced-topics/remote-extensions.md) for details.

## Forwarding or publishing a port

Containers are isolated environments, so if you want to access a server, service, or other resource inside your container, you will need to either "forward" or "[publish](https://stackoverflow.com/a/22150099)" the port to your host. You can either configure your container to always expose these ports or just forward them temporarily.

### Always forwarding a port

You can specify a list of ports you **always** want to forward when attaching or opening a folder in container by using the `forwardPorts` property in `devcontainer.json`.

```json
"forwardPorts": [3000, 3001]
```

Simply reload / reopen the window and the setting will be applied when VS Code connects to the container.

### Temporarily forwarding a port

If you need to access a port that you didn't add to `devcontainer.json` or publish in your Docker Compose file, you can **temporarily forward** a new port for the duration of the session by running the **Forward a Port** command from the Command Palette (`kbstyle(F1)`).

![Forward port input](images/containers/forward-port-containers.png)

After selecting a port, a notification will tell you the localhost port you should use to access the port in the container. For example, if you forwarded an HTTP server listening on port 3000, the notification may tell you that it was mapped to port 4123 on localhost. You can then connect to this remote HTTP server using `http://localhost:4123`.

This same information is available in the **Forwarded Ports** section of the Remote Explorer if you need to access it later.

If you would like VS Code to remember any ports you have forwarded, check **Remote: Restore Forwarded Ports** in the Settings editor (`kb(workbench.action.openSettings)`) or set `"remote.restoreForwardedPorts": true` in `settings.json`.

![Restore forwarded ports setting](images/common/restore-forwarded-ports.png)

### Publishing a port

Docker has the concept of "publishing" ports when the container is created. Published ports behave very much like ports you make available to your local network. If your application only accepts calls from `localhost`, it will reject connections from published ports just as your local machine would for network calls. Forwarded ports, on the other hand, actually look like `localhost` to the application. Each can be useful in different situations.

To publish a port, you can:

1. **Use the appPort property:** If you reference an image or Dockerfile in `devcontainer.json`, you can use the `appPort` property to publish ports to the host.

    ```json
    "appPort": [ 3000, "8921:5000" ]
    ```

2. **Use the Docker Compose ports mapping:** The [ports mapping](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file#ports) can easily be added your `docker-compose.yml` file to publish additional ports.

    ```yaml
    ports:
    - "3000"
    - "8921:5000"
    ```

In each case, you'll need to rebuild your container for the setting to take effect. You can do this by running the **Remote-Containers: Rebuild Container** command in the Command Palette (`kbstyle(F1)`) when you are connected to the container.

## Opening a terminal

Opening a terminal in a container from VS Code is simple. Once you've opened a folder in a container, **any terminal window** you open in VS Code (**Terminal > New Terminal**) will automatically run in the container rather than locally.

You can also use the `code` command line from this same terminal window to perform a number of operations such as opening a new file or folder in the container. Type `code --help` to learn what options are available from the command line.

![Using the code CLI](images/containers/code-command-in-terminal.png)

## Debugging in a container

Once you've opened a folder in a container, you can use VS Code's debugger in the same way you would when running the application locally. For example, if you select a launch configuration in `launch.json` and start debugging (`kb(workbench.action.debug.start)`), the application will start on the remote host and attach the debugger to it.

See the [debugging](/docs/editor/debugging.md) documentation for details on configuring VS Code's debugging features in `.vscode/launch.json`.

## Container specific settings

VS Code's local user settings are also reused when you are connected to a dev container. While this keeps your user experience consistent, you may want to vary some of these settings between your local machine and each container. Fortunately, once you have connected to a container, you can also set container-specific settings by running the **Preferences: Open Remote Settings** command from the Command Palette (`kbstyle(F1)`) or by selecting the **Remote** tab in the Settings editor. These will override any local settings you have in place whenever you connect to the container.

![Container specific settings tab](images/containers/container-settings.png)

### Default container specific settings

You can include defaults for container specific settings in `devcontainer.json` using the `settings` property. These values will be automatically placed in the container specific settings file inside the container once it is created.

For example, adding this to `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` will set the Java home path:

```json
"settings": {
    "java.home": "/docker-java-home"
}
```

Since this just establishes the default, you are still able to change the settings as needed once the container is created.

## Sharing Git credentials with your container

The Remote - Containers extension provides out of box support for using local Git credentials from inside a container. In this section, we'll walk through the two supported options.

If you do not have your user name or email address set up locally, you may be prompted to do so. You can do this on your **local** machine by running the following commands:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@address"
```

The extension will automatically copy your local `.gitconfig` file into the container on startup so you should not need to do this in the container itself.

### Using a credential helper

If you use HTTPS to clone your repositories and **have a [credential helper configured](https://help.github.com/en/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git) in your local OS, no further setup is required.** Credentials you've entered locally will be reused in the container and vice versa.

### Using SSH keys

There are some cases when you may be cloning your repository using SSH keys instead of a credential helper. To enable this scenario, the extension will automatically forward your **local [SSH agent](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/agent) if one is running**.

You can add your local SSH keys to the agent if it is running by using the `ssh-add` command. For example, run this from a terminal or PowerShell:

```bash
ssh-add $HOME/.ssh/github_rsa
```

On Windows and Linux, you may get an error because the agent is not running (macOS typically has it running by default). Follow these steps to resolve the problem:

**Windows**:

Start a **local Administrator PowerShell** and run the following commands:

```powershell
# Make sure you're running as an Administrator
Set-Service ssh-agent -StartupType Automatic
Start-Service ssh-agent
Get-Service ssh-agent
```

**Linux:**

First, start the SSH Agent in the background by running the following in a terminal:

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

Then add these lines to your `~/.bash_profile` so it starts on login:

```bash
if [ -z "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" ]
then
   # Check for a currently running instance of the agent
   RUNNING_AGENT="`ps -ax | grep 'ssh-agent -s' | grep -v grep | wc -l | tr -d '[:space:]'`"
   if [ "$RUNNING_AGENT" = "0" ]
   then
        # Launch a new instance of the agent
        ssh-agent -s &> .ssh/ssh-agent
   fi
   eval `cat .ssh/ssh-agent`
fi
```

## Managing containers

By default, the Remote - Containers extension automatically starts the containers mentioned in the `devcontainer.json` when you open the folder. When you close VS Code, the extension automatically shuts down the containers you've connected to. You can change this behavior by adding `"shutdownAction": "none"` to `devcontainer.json`.

You can also manually manage your containers using one of the following options:

### Option 1: Use the Containers Remote Explorer

From the Containers Explorer, you can right-click on a running container and stop it. You can also start exited containers, remove containers, and remove recent folders. From the Details view, you can forward ports and open already forwarded ports in the browser.

![Containers Explorer screenshot](images/containers/containers-explorer.png)

### Option 2: Use the Docker CLI

1. Open a **local** terminal/PowerShell (or use a local window in VS Code).
2. Type `docker ps` to see running containers. Use `docker ps -a` to also see any stopped containers.
3. Type `docker stop <Container ID>` from this list to stop a container.
4. If you would like to delete a container, type `docker rm <Container ID>` to remove it.

### Option 3: Use Docker Compose

1. Open a **local** terminal/PowerShell (or use a local window in VS Code).
2. Go to the directory with your `docker-compose.yml` file.
3. Type `docker-compose top` to see running processes.
4. Type `docker-compose stop` to stop the containers. If you have more than one Docker Compose file, you can specify additional Docker Compose files with the `-f` argument.
5. If you would like to delete the containers, type `docker-compose down` to both stop and delete them.

If you want to clean out images or mass-delete containers, see [Cleaning out unused containers and images](/docs/remote/troubleshooting.md#cleaning-out-unused-containers-and-images) for different options.

## Personalizing with dotfile repositories

Dotfiles are files whose filename begins with a dot (`.`) and typically contain configuration information for various applications. Since development containers can cover a wide range of application types, it can be useful to store these files somewhere so that you can easily copy them into a container once it is up and running.

A common way to do this is to store these dotfiles in a GitHub repository and then use a utility to clone and apply them. The Remote - Containers extension has built-in support for using these with your own containers. If you are new to the idea, take a look at the different [dotfiles bootstrap repositories](https://dotfiles.github.io/) that exist.

To use it, add your dotfiles GitHub repository to VS Code's User Settings (`kb(workbench.action.openSettings)`) as follows:

![Settings for dotfiles](images/containers/dotfiles.png)

Or in `settings.json`:

```json
{
    "dotfiles.repository": "your-github-id/your-dotfiles-repo",
    "dotfiles.targetPath": "~/dotfiles",
    "dotfiles.installCommand": "~/dotfiles/install.sh"
}
```

From this point forward, the dotfiles repository will be used whenever a container is created.

## In-depth: Setting up a folder to run in a container

There are a few different ways VS Code Remote - Containers can be used to develop an application inside a fully containerized environment. In general, there are two primary scenarios that drive interest in this development style:

* **Stand-Alone Dev Sandboxes:** You may not be deploying your application into a containerized environment but still want to isolate your build and runtime environment from your local OS, speed up setup, or develop in an environment that is more representative of production. For example, you may be running code on your local macOS or Windows machine that will ultimately be deployed to a Linux VM or server, have different toolchain requirements for multiple projects, or want to be able to use tools/packages that could impact your local machine in an unexpected or undesired way. You can reference a container [image or a Dockerfile](#using-an-image-or-dockerfile) for this purpose.

* **Container Deployed Applications**: You deploy your application into one or more containers and would like to work locally in the containerized environment. VS Code currently supports working with container-based applications defined in a number of ways:

  * [Dockerfile](#using-an-image-or-dockerfile): You are working on a single container / service that is described using a single Dockerfile.

  * [Docker Compose](#using-docker-compose): You are working with multiple orchestrated services that are described using a `docker-compose.yml` file.

  * In each case, you may also need to [build container images and deploy to Docker or Kubernetes](/docs/remote/containers-advanced.md#using-docker-or-kubernetes-from-a-container) from inside your container.

  * [Attach only](#attaching-to-running-containers): While not backed by `devcontainer.json`, you can attach to an already running container if none of the workflows described in this section meet your needs.

This section will walk you through configuring your project for each of these situations. The [vscode-dev-containers GitHub repository](https://aka.ms/vscode-dev-containers) also contains dev container definitions to get you up and running quickly.

### Using an image or Dockerfile

You can configure VS Code to reuse an existing image from a source like [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com) or [Azure Container Registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/container-registry/) for your dev container by adding a `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` (or `.devcontainer.json`) config file to your project. In addition, if you are not able to find an image that meets your needs, have a single container-based project, or just want to automate the installation of several additional dependencies, you can use a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) to generate the image instead.

To get started quickly, **open the folder** you want to work with in VS Code and run the **Remote-Containers: Add Development Container Configuration Files...** command in the Command Palette (`kbstyle(F1)`).

![Select Dockerfile](images/containers/select-dockerfile.png)

You'll be asked to either select an existing Dockerfile (if one exists), or pick a pre-defined container configuration from the [vscode-dev-containers repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-dev-containers) in a filterable list. VS Code will then add `devcontainer.json` and any other required files to the folder. While most of these pre-defined "dev container definitions" include a Dockerfile, you can use them as a starting point for an image instead if you prefer.

> **Note:** When using Alpine Linux containers, some extensions may not work due to `glibc` dependencies in native code inside the extension.

You can also create your configuration manually. The difference between configuring VS Code to build a container image using a Dockerfile or just reuse an exiting image is a single property in `devcontainer.json`:

* **To use an image:**  Set the `image` property. For example, this will use the JavaScript and Node.js 12 pre-built [VS Code Development Container image](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-vscode-devcontainers), forward port 3000, install the ES Lint extension, and run `npm install` when done:

    ```json
    {
        "name": "My Project",
        "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/javascript-node:0-12",
        "forwardPorts": [3000],
        "extensions": [
            "dbaeumer.vscode-eslint"
        ],
        "postCreateCommand": "npm install"
    }
    ```

* **To use a Dockerfile:** Set the `dockerFile` property. For example, this will cause VS Code to build the dev container image using the specified `Dockerfile`, forward port 5000, install the C# extension in the container:

    ```json
    {
        "name": "My Node.js App",
        "dockerFile": "Dockerfile",
        "forwardPorts": [5000],
        "extensions": [
            "ms-dotnettools.csharp"
        ]
    }
    ```

See the [devcontainer.json reference](#devcontainerjson-reference) for information on other available properties such as `forwardPorts`, `postCreateCommand`, and the `extensions` list.

Once you have added a `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file to your folder, run the **Remote-Containers: Reopen Folder in Container** command (or **Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...** if you are not yet in VS Code)  from the Command Palette (`kbstyle(F1)`). After the container is created, the **local filesystem is automatically "bind" mount into the container**, unless you [change this behavior](/docs/remote/containers-advanced.md#changing-the-default-source-code-mount), and you can start working with it from VS Code.

However, on Linux, you may need to set up and **specify a non-root user** when using a bind mount or any files you create will be root.  All of the configuration files and images the extension ships with include a non-root user you can specify. See [Adding a non-root user to your dev container](/docs/remote/containers-advanced.md#adding-a-nonroot-user-to-your-dev-container) for details.

```yaml
# Change user for VS Code and sub-processes (terminals, tasks, debugging)
"remoteUser": "your-user-name-here",
# Or change the user for all container processes
"containerUser": "your-user-name-here"
```

You can also add **additional local mount points** to give your container access to other locations using the `mounts` property.

For example, you can mount your home / user profile folder:

```json
"mounts": [
    "source=${localEnv:HOME}${localEnv:USERPROFILE},target=/host-home-folder,type=bind,consistency=cached"
]
```

You can also reference `"${localWorkspaceFolder}` if you need to mount something from the local filesystem into the container.

The `runArgs` property supports the same list of arguments as the [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/) command and can be useful for a wide variety of scenarios including [setting environment variables](/docs/remote/containers-advanced.md#adding-environment-variables).

If your application was built using C++, Go, or Rust, or another language that uses a **ptrace-based debugger**, the `runArgs` property can also be used to configure needed runtime security and capability settings.

For example:

```json
{
    "name": "My Go App",
    "dockerFile": "Dockerfile",
    "extensions": [
        "ms-vscode.go"
    ],
    "runArgs": [
        "--cap-add=SYS_PTRACE",
        "--security-opt",
        "seccomp=unconfined"
    ]
}
```

While less efficient than a custom Dockerfile, you can also use the `postCreateCommand` property to **install additional software** that **may not be in your base image** or for cases where you would prefer **not to modify a deployment Dockerfile** you are reusing.

For example, here is a `devcontainer.json` that adds `git` and the [Git Lens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) extension to the base Debian 9 container image:

```json
{
    "image": "debian:9",
    "extensions": [
        "eamodio.gitlens"
    ],
    "postCreateCommand": "apt-get update && apt-get install -y git"
}
```

See [installing additional software](#installing-additional-software) for more information on using `apt-get` to install software.

This command is run once your source code is mounted, so you can also use the property to run commands like `npm install` or to execute a shell script in your source tree.

```json
"postCreateCommand": "bash scripts/install-dev-tools.sh"
```

By default, when VS Code starts a container, it will **override the container's default command** to be `/bin/sh -c "while sleep 1000; do :; done"`. This is done because the container will stop if the default command fails or exits. However, this may not work for certain images. If the image you are using requires the default command be run to work properly, add the following to your `devcontainer.json` file.

```json
"overrideCommand": false
```

After you create your container for the first time, you will need to run the **Remote-Containers: Rebuild Container** command for updates to `devcontainer.json` or your Dockerfile to take effect.

### Installing additional software

Once VS Code is connected to the container, you can open a VS Code terminal and execute any command against the OS inside the container. This allows you to install new command-line utilities and spin up databases or application services from inside the Linux container.

Most container images are based on Debian or Ubuntu, where the `apt` or `apt-get` command is used to install new packages. You can learn more about the command [in Ubuntu's documentation](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/apt.html). Alpine images include a [similar `apk` command](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine_Linux_package_management) while CentOS / RHEL / Oracle SE / Fedora images [use `yum`](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/deployment_guide/ch-yum) or [more recently `dnf`](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/DNF?rd=Dnf).

Documentation for the software you want to install will usually provide specific instructions, but you may not need to prefix commands with `sudo` if you are running as root in the container.

For example:

```bash
# If running as root
apt-get update
apt-get install <package>
```

If you are running as root, you can install software as long as `sudo` is configured in your container. All predefined containers have `sudo` set up, but the [Advanced Container Configuration](/docs/remote/containers-advanced.md#adding-a-nonroot-user-to-your-dev-container) article can help you set this up for your own containers. Regardless, if you install and configure `sudo` you'll be able to use it when running as any user including root.

```bash
# If sudo is installed and configured
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install <package>
```

However, if you **rebuild** the container, you will have to **reinstall** anything you've installed manually. To avoid this problem, you can either use a series of commands in the `postCreateCommand` property in `devcontainer.json` or the `RUN` instruction [in a custom Dockerfile](#using-an-image-or-dockerfile). You can use `&&` to string together multiple commands.

Using a Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install <packaging>
```

Using `devcontainer.json`:

```json
"postCreateCommand": "apt-get update && apt-get install <package>"
```

Or if running as a [non-root user](/docs/remote/containers-advanced.md#adding-a-nonroot-user-to-your-dev-container):

```json
"postCreateCommand": "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install <package>"
```

The `postCreateCommand` is run once the container is running, so you can also use the property to run commands like `npm install` or to execute a shell script in your source tree (if you have mounted it).

```json
"postCreateCommand": "bash scripts/install-dev-tools.sh"
```

### Using Docker Compose

In some cases, a single container environment isn't sufficient. Fortunately, Remote - Containers supports [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) managed multi-container configurations.

You can either:

1. Work with a service defined in an existing, unmodified `docker-compose.yml`.
2. Create a new `docker-compose.yml` (or make a copy of an existing one) that you use to develop a service.
3. [Extend your existing Docker Compose configuration](#extending-your-docker-compose-file-for-development) to develop the service.
4. Use separate VS Code windows to [work with multiple Docker Compose-defined services](/docs/remote/containers-advanced.md#connecting-to-multiple-containers-at-once) at once.

> **Note:** When using Alpine Linux containers, some extensions may not work due to `glibc` dependencies in native code inside the extension.

VS Code can be configured to **automatically start any needed containers** for a particular service in a Docker Compose file. If you've already started the configured containers using the command line, VS Code will **attach to the running service** you've specified instead. This gives your multi-container workflow the same quick setup advantages described for the Docker image and Dockerfile flows above while still allowing you to use the command line if you prefer.

To get started quickly, **open the folder** you want to work with in VS Code and run the **Remote-Containers: Add Development Container Configuration Files...** command in the Command Palette (`kbstyle(F1)`).

![Select Docker Compose File](images/containers/select-docker-compose.png)

You'll be asked to either select an existing Docker Compose file (if one exists), or pick a pre-defined container configuration from the [vscode-dev-containers repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-dev-containers) in a filterable list. Many of these "dev container definitions" use a Dockerfile, so select one of these definitions for a starting point for Docker Compose: [Existing Docker Compose](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/samples/existing-docker-compose), [Node.js & MongoDB](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/samples/node-mongo), [Python & PostgreSQL](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/samples/python-postgres), or [Docker-in-Docker Compose](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/samples/docker-in-docker-compose). After you make your selection, VS Code will add the appropriate `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` (or `.devcontainer.json`) file to the folder.

You can also create your configuration manually. To reuse a Docker Compose file unmodified, you can use the `dockerComposeFile` and `service` properties in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`.

For example:

```json
{
    "name": "[Optional] Your project name here",
    "dockerComposeFile": "../docker-compose.yml",
    "service": "the-name-of-the-service-you-want-to-work-with-in-vscode",
    "workspaceFolder": "/default/workspace/path/in/container/to/open",
    "shutdownAction": "stopCompose"
}
```

See the [devcontainer.json reference](#devcontainerjson-reference) for information other available properties such as the `workspaceFolder` and `shutdownAction`.

Once you have added a `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file to your folder, run the **Remote-Containers: Reopen Folder in Container** command (or **Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...** if you are not yet in VS Code) from the Command Palette (`kbstyle(F1)`).

If the containers are not already running, VS Code will call `docker-compose -f ../docker-compose.yml up` in this example. The `service` property indicates which service in your Docker Compose file VS Code should connect to, not which service should be started. If you started them by hand, VS Code will attach to the service you specified.

You can also create a development copy of your Docker Compose file. For example, if you had `.devcontainer/docker-compose.devcontainer.yml`, you would just change the following line in `devcontainer.json`:

```json
"dockerComposeFile": "docker-compose.devcontainer.yml"
```

However, a better approach is often to avoid making a copy of your Docker Compose file by **extending it with another one**. We'll cover [extending a Docker Compose file](#extending-your-docker-compose-file-for-development) in the next section.

To avoid having the container shut down if the default container command fails or exits, you can modify your Docker Compose file for the service you have specified in `devcontainer.json` as follows:

```yaml
# Overrides default command so things don't shut down after the process ends.
command: /bin/sh -c "while sleep 1000; do :; done"
```

If you have not done so already, you can **"bind" mount your local source code** into the container using the [volumes list in your Docker Compose file](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#volumes).

For example:

```yaml
volumes:
  # Mounts the project folder to '/workspace'. The target path inside the container
  # should match what your application expects. In this case, the compose file is
  # in a sub-folder, so we will mount '..'. You would then reference this path as the
  # 'workspaceFolder' in '.devcontainer/devcontainer.json' so VS Code starts here.
  - ..:/workspace:cached
```

However, on Linux you may need to set up and **specify a non-root user** when using a bind mount or any files you create will be root. See [Adding a non-root user to your dev container](/docs/remote/containers-advanced.md#adding-a-nonroot-user-to-your-dev-container) for details. To have VS Code run as a different user, add this to `devcontainer.json`:

```json
"remoteUser": "your-user-name-here"
```

If you want all processes to run as a different user, add this to the appropriate service in your Docker Compose file:

```yaml
user: your-user-name-here
```

If you aren't creating a custom Dockerfile for development, you may want to install additional developer tools such as Git inside the service's container. While less efficient than adding these tools to the container image, you can also use the `postCreateCommand` property for this purpose.

```json
"postCreateCommand": "apt-get update && apt-get install -y git"
```

Or if running as a non-root user and `sudo` is installed in the container:

```json
"postCreateCommand": "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y git"
```

See [installing additional software](#installing-additional-software) for more information on using `apt-get` to install software.

If your application was built using C++, Go, or Rust, or another language that uses a ptrace-based debugger, you will also need to add the following settings to your Docker Compose file:

```yaml
# Required for ptrace-based debuggers like C++, Go, and Rust
cap_add:
- SYS_PTRACE
security_opt:
- seccomp:unconfined
```

After you create your container for the first time, you will need to run the **Remote-Containers: Rebuild Container** command for updates to `devcontainer.json`, your Docker Compose files, or related Dockerfiles to take effect.

### Extending your Docker Compose file for development

Referencing an existing deployment / non-development focused `docker-compose.yml` has some potential downsides.

For example:

* Docker Compose will shut down a container if its entry point shuts down. This is problematic for situations where you are debugging and need to restart your app on a repeated basis.
* You also may not be mapping the local filesystem into the container or exposing ports to other resources like databases you want to access.
* You may want to copy the contents of your local `.ssh` folder into the container or set the ptrace options described above in [Using Docker Compose](#using-docker-compose).

You can solve these and other issues like them by extending your entire Docker Compose configuration with [multiple `docker-compose.yml` files](https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/#multiple-compose-files) that override or supplement your primary one.

For example, consider this additional `.devcontainer/docker-compose.extend.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  your-service-name-here:
    volumes:
      # Mounts the project folder to '/workspace'. While this file is in .devcontainer,
      # mounts are relative to the first file in the list, which is a level up.
      - .:/workspace:cached

    # [Optional] Required for ptrace-based debuggers like C++, Go, and Rust
    cap_add:
      - SYS_PTRACE
    security_opt:
      - seccomp:unconfined

    # Overrides default command so things don't shut down after the process ends.
    command: /bin/sh -c "while sleep 1000; do :; done"
```

This same file can provide additional settings, such as port mappings, as needed. To use it, reference your original `docker-compose.yml` file in addition to `.devcontainer/devcontainer.extend.yml` in a specific order:

```json
{
    "name": "[Optional] Your project name here",

    // The order of the files is important since later files override previous ones
    "dockerComposeFile": [
        "../docker-compose.yml",
        "docker-compose.extend.yml"
    ],

    "service": "your-service-name-here",
    "workspaceFolder": "/workspace",
    "shutdownAction": "stopCompose"

}
```

VS Code will then **automatically use both files** when starting up any containers. You can also start them yourself from the command line as follows:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f .devcontainer/docker-compose.extend.yml up
```

While the `postCreateCommand` property allows you to install additional tools inside your container, in some cases you may want to have a specific Dockerfile for development. You can also use this same approach to reference a custom `Dockerfile` specifically for development without modifying your existing Docker Compose file.  For example, you can update `.devcontainer/devcontainer.extend.yml` as follows:

```yaml

### Docker Compose dev container definitions

The following are dev container definitions that use Docker Compose:

* [Existing Docker Compose](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/samples/existing-docker-compose) - Includes a set of files that you can drop into an existing project that will reuse a `docker-compose.yml` file in the root of your project.

* [Node.js & MongoDB](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/samples/node-mongo) -  A Node.js container that connects to a Mongo DB in a different container.

* [Python & PostgreSQL](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/samples/python-postgres) -  A Python container that connects to PostGreSQL in a different container.

* [Docker-in-Docker Compose](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/samples/docker-in-docker-compose) - Includes the Docker CLI and illustrates how you can use it to access your local Docker install from inside a dev container by volume mounting the Docker Unix socket.

## devcontainer.json reference

See [Setting up a folder to run in a container](#in-depth-setting-up-a-folder-to-run-in-a-container) for more information on configuring a dev container or the [vscode-dev-containers repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/tree/master/containers) for a wide variety of base configurations.

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
|**Dockerfile or image**|||
| `image` | string | **Required** when [using an image](#using-an-image-or-dockerfile). The name of an image in a container registry ([DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com), [Azure Container Registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/container-registry/)) that VS Code should use to create the dev container. |
| `dockerFile` | string |**Required** when [using a Dockerfile](#using-an-image-or-dockerfile). The location of a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) that defines the contents of the container. The path is relative to the `devcontainer.json` file. You can find a number of sample Dockerfiles for different runtimes in the [vscode-dev-containers repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/tree/master/containers). |
| `context` | string | Path that the Docker build should be run from relative to `devcontainer.json`. For example, a value of `".."` would allow you to reference content in sibling directories. Defaults to `"."`. |
| `appPort` | integer,<br>string,<br>array |  In most cases, we recommend using the new [forwardPorts property](#always-forwarding-a-port). This property accepts a port or array of ports that should be [published](#publishing-a-port) locally when the container is running. Unlike `forwardPorts`, your application may need to listen on all interfaces (`0.0.0.0`) not just `localhost` for it to be available externally. Defaults to `[]`. |
| `containerEnv` | object | A set of name-value pairs that sets or overrides environment variables for the container. The value can reference local OS variable values using the following format: `${localEnv:VARIABLE_NAME}`.<br>For example: `"containerEnv": { "MY_VARIABLE": "${localEnv:MY_VARIABLE}" }`<br>Requires the container be recreated / rebuilt to change. |
| `remoteEnv` | object | A set of name-value pairs that sets or overrides environment variables for VS Code (or sub-processes like terminals) but not the container as a whole. The value can reference local OS variable values using the following format: `${localEnv:VARIABLE_NAME}`.<br>It can also reference or update an existing variable in the container using this format: `${containerEnv:VARIABLE_NAME}`<br>Updates are applied when VS Code is restarted (or the window is reloaded).<br>For example: `"remoteEnv": { "PATH": "${containerEnv:PATH}:/some/other/path", "MY_VARIABLE": "${localEnv:MY_VARIABLE}" }` |
| `containerUser` | string | Overrides the user all operations run as inside the container. Defaults to either `root` or the last `USER` instruction in the related Dockerfile used to create the image.<br>On Linux, the specified container user's UID/GID will be updated to match the local user's UID/GID to avoid permission problems with bind mounts (unless disabled using `updateRemoteUserID`).<br>Requires the container be recreated / rebuilt for updates to take effect. |
| `remoteUser` | string | Overrides the user that VS Code runs as in the container (along with sub-processes like terminals, tasks, or debugging). Defaults to the `containerUser`.<br>On Linux, the specified container user's UID/GID will be updated to match the local user's UID/GID to avoid permission problems with bind mounts (unless disabled using `updateRemoteUserID`).<br>Updates are applied when VS Code is restarted (or the window is reloaded), but UID/GID updates are only applied when the container is created and requires a rebuild to change. |
| `updateRemoteUserUID` | boolean | On Linux, if `containerUser` or `remoteUser` is specified, the container user's UID/GID will be updated to match the local user's UID/GID to avoid permission problems with bind mounts. Defaults to `true`.<br>Requires the container be recreated / rebuilt for updates to take effect. |
| `mounts` | array | An array of additional mount points to add to the container. Each value is a string that accepts the same values as the [Docker CLI `--mount` flag](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#add-bind-mounts-or-volumes-using-the---mount-flag). You can use `${localWorkspaceFolder}` in this property to refer to the local source code or using the following format to refer to environment variables: `${localEnv:VARIABLE_NAME}`.<br>For example: `"mounts": ["source=${localEnv:HOME}${localEnv:USERPROFILE},target=/host-home-folder,type=bind,consistency=cached"]` |
| `workspaceMount` | string | Overrides the default local mount point for the workspace. Supports the same values as the [Docker CLI `--mount` flag](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#add-bind-mounts-or-volumes-using-the---mount-flag). Primarily useful for [configuring remote containers](/docs/remote/containers-advanced.md#developing-inside-a-container-on-a-remote-docker-host) or [improving disk performance](/docs/remote/containers-advanced.md#improving-container-disk-performance). You can use `${localWorkspaceFolder}` in this property to refer to the local source code or using the following format to refer to environment variables: `${localEnv:VARNAMEHERE}` |
| `workspaceFolder` | string | Sets the default path that VS Code should open when connecting to the container. Typically used in conjunction with `workspaceMount`. Defaults to the automatic source code mount location. |
| `runArgs` | array | An array of [Docker CLI arguments](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/) that should be used when running the container. Defaults to `[]`.<br>For example, `"runArgs": [ "--cap-add=SYS_PTRACE", "--security-opt", "seccomp=unconfined" ]` allows ptrace based debuggers like C++ to work in the container.<br>If required, values can use `${localWorkspaceFolder}` to refer to the local source code path or `${localEnv:VARABLE_NAME}` to refer to local environment variables. |
| `build.args` | Object | An object containing [Docker image build arguments](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#set-build-time-variables---build-arg) that should be passed when building a Dockerfile. You can refer to local environment variables using the syntax `${localEnv:VARABLE_NAME}`. Defaults to not set. For example: `"build": { "args": { "MYARG": "MYVALUE", "MYARGFROMENVVAR": "${localEnv:VARABLE_NAME}" } }` |
| `build.target` | string | An string that specifies a [Docker image build target](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#specifying-target-build-stage---target) that should be passed when building a Dockerfile Defaults to not set. For example: `"build": { "target": "development" }` |
| `overrideCommand` | boolean | Tells VS Code whether it should run `/bin/sh -c "while sleep 1000; do :; done"` when starting the container instead of the container's default command. Defaults to `true` since the container can shut down if the default command fails. Set to `false` if the default command must run for the container to function properly. |
| `shutdownAction` | enum | Indicates whether VS Code should stop the container when the VS Code window is closed / shut down.<br>Values are `none` and `stopContainer` (default). |
|**Docker Compose**|||
| `dockerComposeFile` | string,<br>array | **Required.** Path or an ordered list of paths to Docker Compose files relative to the `devcontainer.json` file. Using an array is useful [when extending your Docker Compose configuration](#extending-your-docker-compose-file-for-development). The order of the array matters since the contents of later files can override values set in previous ones.<br>The default `.env` file is picked up from the root of the project, but you can use `env_file` in your Docker Compose file to specify an alternate location. |
| `service` | string | **Required.** The name of the service VS Code should connect to once running.  |
| `runServices` | array | An array of services in your Docker Compose configuration that should be started by VS Code. These will also be stopped when you disconnect unless `"shutdownAction"` is `"none"`. Defaults to all services. |
| `workspaceFolder` | string | Sets the default path that VS Code should open when connecting to the container (which is often the path to a volume mount where the source code can be found in the container). Defaults to `"/"`. |
| `remoteEnv` | object | A set of name-value pairs that sets or overrides environment variables for VS Code (or sub-processes like terminals) but not the container as a whole. The value can reference local OS variable values using the following format: `${localEnv:VARIABLE_NAME}`.<br>It can also reference or update an existing variable in the container using this format: `${containerEnv:VARIABLE_NAME}`.<br>Updates are applied when VS Code is restarted (or the window is reloaded).<br>For example: `"remoteEnv": { "PATH": "${containerEnv:PATH}:/some/other/path", "MY_VARIABLE": "${localEnv:MY_VARIABLE}" }` |
| `remoteUser` | string | Overrides the user that VS Code runs as in the container (along with sub-processes like terminals, tasks, or debugging). Does not change the user the container as a whole runs as (which can be [set in your Docker Compose file](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#domainname-hostname-ipc-mac_address-privileged-read_only-shm_size-stdin_open-tty-user-working_dir)). Defaults to the user the container as a whole is running as (often `root`).<br>Updates are applied when VS Code is restarted (or the window is reloaded). |
| `shutdownAction` | enum | Indicates whether VS Code should stop the containers when the VS Code window is closed / shut down.<br>Values are  `none` and `stopCompose` (default). |
|**General**|||
| `name` | string | A display name for the container. |
| `extensions` | array | An array of extension IDs that specify the extensions that should be installed inside the container when it is created. Defaults to `[]`. |
| `settings` | object | Adds default `settings.json` values into a container/machine specific settings file.  |
| `forwardPorts` | array | An array of ports that should be forwarded from inside the container to the local machine. |
| `postCreateCommand` | string,<br>array | A command string or list of command arguments to run after the container is created. The commands execute from the `workspaceFolder` in the container. Use `&&` in a string to execute multiple commands. For example, `"yarn install"` or `"apt-get update && apt-get install -y git"`. The array syntax `["yarn", "install"]` will invoke the command (in this case `yarn`) directly without using a shell. <br />It fires after your source code has been mounted, so you can also run shell scripts from your source tree. For example: `bash scripts/install-dev-tools.sh`. Not set by default. |
| `initializeCommand` | string,<br>array | A command string or list of command arguments to run **locally** before  The commands execute from the `workspaceFolder` locally. For example, `"yarn install"`. The array syntax `["yarn", "install"]` will invoke the command (in this case `yarn`) directly without using a shell. |
| `devPort` | integer | Allows you to force a specific port that the VS Code Server should use in the container. Defaults to a random, available port. |

If you've already built the container and connected to it, be sure to run **Remote-Containers: Rebuild Container** from the Command Palette (`kbstyle(F1)`) to pick up the change.

### Attached container config reference

[Attached container configuration files](#attached-container-configuration-files) are similar to `devcontainer.json` and supports a subset of its properties.

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `workspaceFolder` | string | Sets the default path that VS Code should open when connecting to the container (which is often the path to a volume mount where the source code can be found in the container). Not set by default (an empty window is opened). |
| `extensions` | array | An array of extension IDs that specify the extensions that should be installed inside the container when it is created. Defaults to `[]`. |
| `settings` | object | Adds default `settings.json` values into a container/machine specific settings file.  |
| `forwardPorts` | array | A list of ports that should be forwarded from inside the container to the local machine. |
| `remoteEnv` | object | A set of name-value pairs that sets or overrides environment variables for VS Code (or sub-processes like terminals) but not the container as a whole. The value can reference local OS variable values using the following format: `${localEnv:VARIABLE_NAME}`.<br>It can also reference or update an existing variable in the container using this format: `${containerEnv:VARIABLE_NAME}`.<br>Updates are applied when VS Code is restarted (or the window is reloaded / you re-attach).<br>For example: `"remoteEnv": { "PATH": "${containerEnv:PATH}:/some/other/path", "MY_VARIABLE": "${localEnv:MY_VARIABLE}" }`|
| `remoteUser` | string | Overrides the user that VS Code runs as in the container (along with sub-processes like terminals, tasks, or debugging). Defaults to the user the container as a whole is running as (often `root`).<br>Updates are applied when VS Code is restarted (or the window is reloaded / you re-attach). |

## Known limitations

### Remote - Containers limitations

* Windows container images are **not** yet supported.
* Using a remote Docker Host is possible, but requires [additional setup steps](/docs/remote/containers-advanced.md#developing-inside-a-container-on-a-remote-docker-host).
* All roots/folders in a multi-root workspace will be opened in the same container, regardless of whether there are configuration files at lower levels.
* The unofficial Ubuntu Docker **snap** package for Linux is **not** supported. Follow the [official Docker install instructions for your distribution](https://docs.docker.com/install/#supported-platforms).
* Docker Toolbox on Windows is not supported.
* Docker variants or alternate containerization tool kits like [Podman](https://podman.io) are not supported.
* If you clone a Git repository using SSH and your SSH key has a passphrase, VS Code's pull and sync features may hang when running remotely. Either use an SSH key without a passphrase, clone using HTTPS, or run `git push` from the command line to work around the issue.
* Local proxy settings are not reused inside the container, which can prevent extensions from working unless the appropriate proxy information is configured (for example global `HTTP_PROXY` or `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables with the appropriate proxy information).

See [here for a list of active issues](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/issues) related to Containers.

### Docker limitations

* First-time installs of Docker Desktop for Windows will require an additional "sharing" step to give your container access to local source code. However, this step may not work with certain AAD (email-based) identities. See [Docker Desktop for Windows tips](/docs/remote/troubleshooting.md#docker-desktop-for-windows-tips) and [Enabling file sharing in Docker Desktop](/docs/remote/troubleshooting.md#enabling-file-sharing-in-docker-desktop) for details and workarounds.
* You may see errors if you sign in to Docker with your email address instead of your Docker ID. This is a known issue and can be resolved by signing in with your Docker ID instead. See Docker [issue #935](https://github.com/docker/hub-feedback/issues/935#issuecomment-300361781) for details.
* If you see high CPU spikes for `com.docker.hyperkit` on macOS, this may be due to a [known issue with Docker for Mac](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/1759). See the Docker issue for details.
* If you see either of these messages building a Dockerfile, you may be hitting a known Docker issue with Debian 8 (Jessie):

    ```text
    W: Failed to fetch http://deb.debian.org/debian/dists/jessie-updates/InRelease
    E: Some index files failed to download. They have been ignored, or old ones used instead
    ```

    See [Resolving Dockerfile build failures](/docs/remote/troubleshooting.md#resolving-dockerfile-build-failures-for-images-using-debian-8) for a workaround.

See the Docker troubleshooting guide for [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/troubleshoot) or [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/troubleshoot), consult [Docker Support Resources](https://success.docker.com/article/best-support-resources) for more information.

### Docker Extension limitations

By default, the Docker extension will run remotely. While this is a sensible default for SSH and WSL 2, it means the extension will not show local containers when VS Code is connected to a container.

You can use one of the following solutions to resolve this problem:

* Open a new local window (**File > New Window**) and use it to work with local containers.

* Install the [Remote - Containers](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/download/containers) extension and use the [Remote Explorer](/docs/remote/containers.md#option-1-use-the-containers-remote-explorer) in situations when you need to see your local containers.

* Forward the [Docker socket and install the Docker CLI](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/samples/docker-in-docker) (only) in the container.

* Use the [extensionKind property](#advanced-forcing-an-extension-to-run-locally-or-remotely) to force the extension to be `ui`. However, this will prevent some commands from working.

### Extension limitations

Many extensions will work inside dev containers without modification. However, in some cases, certain features may require changes. If you run into an extension issue, see [here for a summary of common problems and solutions](/docs/remote/troubleshooting.md#extension-tips) that you can mention to the extension author when reporting the issue.

In addition, while Alpine support is available, some extensions installed in the container may not work due to `glibc` dependencies in native code inside the extension. See the [Remote Development with Linux](/docs/remote/linux.md) article for details.

## Common questions

### I am seeing errors when trying to mount the local filesystem into a container

Right-click on the Docker task bar item. On Windows, select the **Settings** menu item then **Resources > File Sharing** and check the drive(s) where your source code is located. On macOS, select the **Preferences** menu item then **Resources > File Sharing** and make sure the folder containing your source code is under a file path specified in the list.

See [Docker Desktop for Windows tips](/docs/remote/troubleshooting.md#docker-desktop-for-windows-tips) for information on workarounds to common Docker for Windows issues.

### I am seeing "W: Failed to fetch ..." when building a Dockerfile

If you see "W: Failed to fetch http://deb.debian.org/debian/dists/jessie-updates/InRelease" when building a Dockerfile, you may be hitting a known Docker issue with Debian 8 (Jessie). See [Resolving Dockerfile build failures](/docs/remote/troubleshooting.md#resolving-dockerfile-build-failures-for-images-using-debian-8) for a workaround.

### I'm seeing an error about a missing library or dependency

Some extensions rely on libraries not found in specific Docker images. For example, [Visual Studio Live Share](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/) requires the installation of system-level dependencies, which are [listed in their documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/liveshare/reference/linux#install-prerequisites-manually). The need for these dependencies may depend on the operating system (for example, specific Linux distribution) used by your Docker image. You may need to install these dependencies during the Docker build process, by adding required commands to your Dockerfile. Search the specific extension's documentation to check for dependencies and see [Installing additional software](#installing-additional-software) for help with resolving the problem.

### Can I connect to multiple containers at once?

A VS Code window can only connect to one window currently, but you can open a new window and [attach](#attaching-to-running-containers) to an already running container or [use a common Docker Compose file with multiple `devcontainer.json` files](/docs/remote/containers-advanced.md#connecting-to-multiple-containers-at-once) to automate the process a bit more.

### Can I work with containers on a remote host?

Yes, you can either attach to a container running on a remote host or create a specialized `devcontainer.json` to tell VS Code how to work with your remote environment. To access the host, you can either connect to a publicly exposed Docker daemon TCP port or use SSH to tunnel into a remote VM running Docker. See [Developing inside a container on a remote Docker host](/docs/remote/containers-advanced.md#developing-inside-a-container-on-a-remote-docker-host) for details.

### How can I build or deploy container images into my local Docker / Kubernetes install when working inside a container?

You can build images and deploy containers by forwarding the Docker socket and installing the Docker CLI (and kubectl for Kubernetes) in the container. See the [Docker-in-Docker](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/samples/docker-in-docker), [Docker-in-Docker Compose](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/samples/docker-in-docker-compose), and [Kubernetes-Helm](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/samples/kubernetes-helm) dev container definitions for details.

### What are the connectivity requirements for the VS Code Server when it is running in a container?

Installation of VS Code Server requires that your local machine have outbound HTTPS (port 443) connectivity to:

* `update.code.visualstudio.com`
* `vscode.blob.core.windows.net`
* `*.vo.msecnd.net` (Azure CDN)

The Remote - Containers extensions will download VS Code Server locally and copy it to the container once connected.

You can install extensions manually without an internet connection using the **Extensions: Install from VSIX...** command, but if you use the extension panel or `devcontainer.json` to install extensions, your local machine and VS Code Server will need outbound HTTPS (port 443) access  to:

* `marketplace.visualstudio.com`
* `*.vo.msecnd.net` (Azure CDN)
* `*.gallerycdn.vsassets.io` (Azure CDN)

Finally, some extensions (like C#) download secondary dependencies from `download.microsoft.com` or `download.visualstudio.microsoft.com`. Others (like [Visual Studio Live Share](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/liveshare/reference/connectivity#requirements-for-connection-modes)) may have additional connectivity requirements. Consult the extension's documentation for details if you run into trouble.

VS Code Server runs on a random port inside the container and VS Code itself uses `docker exec` to communicate with it over Docker's configured communication channel.

### Can I use the extension with source code stored in WSL2 on Windows?

If you are using [Docker Desktop's WSL2 engine](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl-tech-preview/), you can enable experimental support in the Remote - Containers extension that will allow you to open folders from the `\\wsl$` share in a container. Simply check **Remote > Containers: Experimental WSL** in [VS Code settings](/docs/getstarted/settings.md) and restart VS Code. See [this excellent blog post](https://stuartleeks.com/posts/vscode-devcontainers-wsl/) for complete setup details.

### As an extension author, what do I need to do to make sure my extension works?

The VS Code extension API hides most of the implementation details of running remotely so many extensions will just work inside dev containers without any modification. However, we recommend that you test your extension in a dev container to be sure that all of its functionality works as expected. See the article on [Supporting Remote Development](/api/advanced-topics/remote-extensions.md) for details.
